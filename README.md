# Setup Project Locally 😀

> ⚠ Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.19.0/win-x64/) version >16 (recommended : v16.19.0 LTS).

> I recommand to use [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (node version manager) to handle different versions of node 😊

**Let's go to client side 📱**

    cd client

First install npm modules 😌

    npm install

Then create a new _.env_ file in client folder and paste all content from _.env.example_ (do not delete this file) to _.env_ 🤫

    cp .env.example .env

Create firebase project and add all the details to in .env file. 🥱
Start development server by running below command

    npm run dev

**Now let's move to server side 🌐**

    cd server

Repeat the rule of npm world 🤨

    npm install

Once again 😐 create a new _.env_ file in server folder and paste all content from _.env.example_ (do not delete this file) to _.env_

    cp .env.example .env

You have to provide mail id and app password. Then firebase serviceAccount credentials and planetscale database url.
Start development server by running below command (No need for nodemon 😉)
